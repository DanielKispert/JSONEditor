# JSONEditor

allows editing JSON files to certain templates in a kind of more streamlined UI

will become a website/server at some point, swing UI as a placeholder until then

workflow:

1. select schema
2. select file to edit (or skip)
3. try validating file through schema
4. if no, file cannot be edited, it has to match the format. New File and Schema must be chosen
5. if yes, file can be edited
